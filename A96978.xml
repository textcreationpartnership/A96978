         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>8</label> But if it be objected, That believers have alſo thoſe pretious Promiſes given them, whereby they may be <hi>Partakers of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 4. To this it is anſwered, that although it be ſo, yet the manner of <hi>Believers partaking of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> is different from that <hi>manner</hi> of unity, of the <hi>Divine and Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the Perſon of Chriſt,</hi> in ſeveral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>In the Humane Nature of Christ, dwells the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily,</hi> Col. 2. 9. But in Believers, <hi>the Godhead doth not dwell bodily.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Body of Chriſt who was born of <hi>Mary,</hi> was not <hi>Conceived,</hi> that is, formed or faſhioned in his Mothers Womb, <hi>but by and of the Holy Spirit,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity: But the bodies of thoſe that are Believers, were not conceived in their Mothers Wombs by any ſuch <hi>ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Holy Spirit;</hi> God forbid we ſhould once preſume to think ſo.</p>
               <p>For Thirdly, The <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Body of Chriſt, <hi>of her Seed or Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance by the operation of the Holy Spirit,</hi> the ſecond Perſon in the Trinity, <hi>without</hi>

                  <hi>her knowing of man, Luke</hi> 1. 34. 35. But the Bodies of thoſe men and women that are Believers and Saints by calling, were conceived of their Mothers, <hi>not without their knowing of man, and without any ſuch operation of the Holy Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, The Humane Nature of Chriſts Perſon, <hi>never ſubſiſted of it ſelf,</hi> but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes was in <hi>Perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity with the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and ſubſiſted by it,</hi> ſo that in him the <hi>Godhead dwelt bodily;</hi> but it is not ſo with <hi>others Perſons,</hi> though they are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and though their Subſtance be the ſame with the Humane Nature of Chriſt; yet it <hi>doth not ſubſiſt as the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Chriſts Perſon</hi> doth; for all Perſons, excepting Chriſt, do ſubſiſt <hi>without the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal Unity of the Godhead; but the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſts Perſon, did never ſubſiſt without the Perſonal Unity of the Godhead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore, Fifthly, That we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how Believers <hi>do partake of the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature,</hi> it is needful to conſider, what <hi>that Divine Nature is, that Believers are ſaid to partake</hi> of, and after <hi>what manner</hi> they do partake of it: The Divine Nature then of which participation is promiſed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to believers, <hi>is their attaining unto an emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent</hi>

                  <hi>reſemblance of that bleſſed eſtate and condition, wherein the Humane Nature of the Perſon of Chriſt, now is ſince his Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from the dead, and aſcention to his Father,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 29. For ſaith he, <hi>Whom God did foreknow, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the Image of his Son, that he might be the firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born among many Brethren;</hi> for as Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers <hi>have born the Image of the earthly, ſo ſhall they alſo bear the Image of the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly,</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 49. That as the <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature of Chriſt, could not be held of death, becauſe it was in Perſonal Unity with the Divine Nature;</hi> So thoſe that are in Covenant with Chriſt, <hi>ſhall not be held of the firſt,</hi> neither ſhall they <hi>enter into the ſecond death;</hi> not becauſe they are <hi>perſonal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly united unto the Divine Nature or God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> as the Humane Nature of Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is, but becauſe they, as <hi>all mankind are, of one ſubſtance with the Humane Nature of Chriſt;</hi> Therefore <hi>all ſhall be brought out of the Grave,</hi> and ſuch as are alſo <hi>in Covenant with him, whoſe Humane Nature is perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally united unto the Godhead, ſhall not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the ſecond death;</hi> for as the <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head of Chriſt did quicken that Humane Nature, which is in Perſonal Unity with it;</hi>

The Divine Nature filled the Humane Nature in the Perſon of Chriſt, that He might pour out of his fulneſs, to the ſame Humane Nature in the perſons of others; the Humane Nature of Chriſts Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon did ſo perticipate of the Divine Nature, that his Conception, Birth, Life, Sufferings and Death, was Pure and Holy, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of infinite worth in the ſight of God the Father; that ſo they whoſe Conception, Birth and Life is polluted and unclean, and whoſe death is the wages of their ſins, might be ſet free from ſin and from death, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tituled unto eternal Life; for in the fleſh of Chriſt, ſin was ſo condemned, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. that neither unto the <hi>guilt of ſin, dominion of ſin,</hi> nor <hi>unto any puniſhment due for any ſin done by him, was he lyable;</hi> it was to ſet free the perſons of others from the Guilt, Dominion and Puniſhment due to them for their ſins, that he underwent the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; he that knew no ſin, being made a

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>16</label> But that thy diſſimulation may further appear, I ſhall in ſeveral particulars make it manifeſt; that thou never intendeſt that every
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:153030:93"/> man ſhould be guided by that Light which they have in them, before they meet with thee, or thy Doctrine; but that they ſhould receive inſtruction, and a ſpirit from thee to be their director and aſſiſter. Firſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that when thou doeſt affirm, that the Apoſtles of Jeſus Chriſt were ſent out to Baptize with the Spirit, this thou ſpeakeſt to oppoſe thoſe that ſtand to maintain that they were commanded <hi>to Baptize with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins, and by Prayer, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on of hands, to ſeek unto God, that he would give his Spirit,</hi> as he hath promiſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 9, 13. Therefore thou calleſt <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm in water, carnal; Prayer and laying on of hands, carnal;</hi> becauſe not the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrator of Prayer and laying on of hands, but God doth give Chriſt to ſhed forth or baptize with the holy Spirit, See <hi>Acts</hi> 5. 32. <hi>Acts</hi> 2. 33. <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 11. Now if I muſt believe that what thou ſpeakeſt of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles of Chriſt, thoſe that are thy meſſengers can perform, then conſequently they can Baptize with a ſpirit, and give a ſpirit to them, which do receive their counſel, or elſe they are not lawful Preachers by thy own confeſſion; ſo that thou intendeſt to Communicate a Teacher from without,
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:153030:93"/> whatſoever thou declareſt of the ſufficiency of the Light within. For,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Thou intendeſt not that men and women ſhould be guided by the Light which is within them, before they receive inſtruction and a ſpirit from thee which art without them; becauſe thy Teachers do declare to men and women, that if they will but wait in ſilence, be ſtill and quiet, ceaſe from outward and Scripture-teaching, Forms, and carnal Ordinances, that they ſhall receive vertue, life and ſtrength from them, though they never ſee their faces any more; by which it appears plainly, that thou intendeſt to give a ſpirit to ſuch as ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>here to thy Doctrine, for otherwiſe theſe thy promiſes of <hi>Vertue, Life,</hi> and <hi>Strength</hi> to be received from thee, are vain, and thou not faithful that makeſt them. But,</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Thou never intendeſt that men and women ſhould be guided by the Light which is within them, before they receive inſtruction from thee, and that thou giveſt them a ſpirit, becauſe that when thou takeſt hold of the hand of men and women, or layeſt thy hands on their fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads, or on their ſhoulders, great trouble comes upon their ſpirits within them; yea, when thou haſt taken hold of the w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iſts of
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:153030:94"/> the hands of ſome, while they have been oppoſing thee, they have been taken with ſuch a trembling, that they could not ſpeak, nor hold ſtill, nor get away from thee; by which it is apparent, that thy intent is to communicate a ſpirit.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Thy intent is not that men and women ſhould be guided by the Light which is within them, before they receive inſtruction and a ſpirit from thee, &amp;c. be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe as ſoon as ever thou apprehendeſt that any man or woman is inclinable to thy Principles, thou art conſtantly viſiting them, until thou haſt brought them over to thy ways; once in thirteen days at the leaſt, thou wilt be praying with them after thy faſhion, untill they be brought out of that laborynth into which thou haſt brought them, and ſuch a ſtir there is about this work, and ſo vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have ſome of you been affected with it, that ye have ſent to the Bel-man of a City, to cry it up, and down, that all that would be free to come, might come and ſee this imaginary Reſurrection, or rather Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of your unclean ſpirit; by which thou doſt plainly declare, that the Light in every man will not do the buſineſs, but a ſpirit muſt be communicated, for what elſe is it that thou ſo earneſtly endeavoureſt to
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:153030:94"/> raiſe up? What elſe is it that thou takeſt ſo much delight in, when thou feeleſt it? as hath been ſaid by ſome of you, Ariſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in man: About what elſe are thy groanes ſpent? what elſe doeſt thou viſit? with what elſe doeſt thou, as thou ſayeſt ſuffer, but with that ſpirit which thou haſt given? which till he hath taken full poſſeſſion of the Creature, that ſo he may become as much the Child of perdition as thy ſelf, thou art in a troubled condition.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, That thou doeſt not intend that by the Light which is in every one, before they receive inſtruction from thee, they ſhould be guided, appears by thy running up and down to ſpread thy Doctrine, and by thy Printing ſuch a multitude of Books; all which is done to teach and inſtruct men in thy way, and to direct them how to walk according to thy deſire: thou cryeſt down Preaching, and yet uſeſt it; thou cryeſt down the Letter, and Scriptures of Truth; and yet makeſt uſe of Letter, and writeſt many Books, thereby to diſperſe thy falſe Doctrine; and even like the Phariſees, ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Commandment of God, that ye may keep your own Traditions, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 9. ye lay aſide Gods Word, and ſet up your own word; Gods holy Scriptures ye reject, your
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:153030:95"/> own unholy writings ye exalt, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſetting up the Light, which ye ſay is within every man, ye ſet up the darkneſs which is within your ſelves, and from you communicated to ſuch as you can perſwade to hear your words, or read your Books, thus thy pretentions and intentions are like <hi>Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> Foxes, <hi>Judg.</hi> 15. 4, 5. not united by the heads, yet ſo tyed together by the Tayls, as <hi>between them, they carry fire to burn up ſtanding corn, ſhocks of corn, Vineyards, and Olives;</hi> thou calleſt thy Doctrine fire, and ſayeſt <hi>thou art baptized with the ſpirit and fire:</hi> I do believe thou art baptized with a ſpirit and fire indeed, which may ſeem to burn up weeds, but it is ſent againſt the good Corn, the beſt Graces, <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> is burnt up in ſuch as receive thy Doctrine, by the fire of that unclean ſpirit with which thou art baptized.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Thou doeſt not intend that the Light which is within every man ſhould onely be his director, becauſe that Light which is in every man doth not lead thee and thy followers to do thoſe things ye do; for if it be a Light which is within every man, by which onely thou art carryed on in thy way, why then doth it not ſpeak the ſame things in every one as it doth in thee?
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:153030:95"/> why doth it not make every one quake and tremble as well as thee, if every one have it? why is it ſilent in ſo many? why doth it not throw every one down upon the ground, ſwell their bellies, roar in them, and ſpeak with a vocal voice as well as in thee, and thy followers? If you ſay, it is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe the Light is in priſon in thoſe in whom it is not ſo active as it is in thee: It is anſwered, that by that reaſon it ſhould be the more active, if it be ſenſible of its bondage; and if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible how then can it be ſufficient to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form thoſe things which thou aſcribeſt to it: What is it dead or ſenceleſs? doth it not feel that hard and ſore oppreſſion under which it lies, or is it aſleep, and muſt be awaked? if ſo, it is much unlike to make a man a new Creature, to lead him out of <hi>all ſin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and eternally to ſave him;</hi> For how ſhould that deliver a man out of Priſon, that is ſo unſenſible of its own bondage? That muſt needs be in a ſmall capacity to help another, that is not ſenſible of its own wants; neither canſt thou ſay it doth in all and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one, what it doth in thee; for I my ſelf, and many others, can and do teſtifie the contrary; if thou ſay, it is by reaſon of our long ſinning: it is anſwered, that you in whom the Light (as you call it) is ſo prevalent, have been long
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:153030:96"/> ſinners and are ſo ſtill; and if you are guid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by no other thing than that Light which is in every man, why doth it not do in all the ſame that it doth in you? why doth it not make all little Children to quake and tremble in their mothers laps, as that ſpirit which you call the Light within, hath cauſed ſome little Children to do, where ſome of you have been preſent?</p>

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> bottles: So ſome of you have had a voyce ſpeaking to them, from the hollow or bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of their bellies, which is no other than the voyce of the evil ſpirit; and indeed by what elſe are you inabled at your meetings, when you have nothing to ſay, but by a ſpirit that comes into ſome of you, by which ye are made able to ſpeak 2, or 3. hours? and then when ye have done, are as empty
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:153030:96"/> again as if no ſuch thing had been; and ſo by the ſaid ſpirits going out of one into another, thoſe things are performed which you aſcribe to the Light within all men, and as it hath been ſaid by ſome of your ſelves, <hi>Life goes to Life, Life goes to Life;</hi> So it is manifeſt that by the aſſiſtance of that ſpirit that comes from one, and goes to another, and not by the Light within all men, are you inabled to do thoſe things ye do; and that hollow, humming, ſighing and ſpeaking, is not from the Light within all men, nor from the Light within your ſelves, but from the ſpirit of darkneſs, which you have received, and are his inſtruments to help others to receive. For,</p>
               <p>Secondly, Your ſilent meetings of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or muttering, is the direct practice of ſuch as have familiar ſpirits, as the Prophet teacheth, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 19. For the word tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated <hi>Mutter,</hi> ſignifies a ſilent Meditation, or muttering, as they that underſtand the Hebrew word do obſerve; To what end therefore are your ſilent Meetings of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations or Mutterings, but for the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating your unclean ſpirit; for never did any of the Churches of Chriſt or ſervants of the living God, hold Meetings of ſilence to meet and ſpeak not one word to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:153030:97"/> is ſuch a practice of which there is not any example in the Word of God, but even the contrary is found there; for it is written, They that feared the Lord ſpake often one to another, and the Lord heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned and heard it &amp;c. <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 16. So that it is certain, that the Practice of ſilent Meetings is contrary to the Practice of the People of God in all ages; Therefore the Scripture, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 8. 19. is worth thy further conſideration, as it is there written, <hi>When they ſhall ſay unto you, Seek unto them that have familiar ſpirits, and unto Wizards that peepe, and that mutter; Should not a People ſeek unto their God, for the living to the dead?</hi> Now the Spirit of God upon this accompt, gives warning and inſtruction in the very next words, verſ. 20. ſaying, <hi>To the Law, and to the Teſtimony, if they ſpeak not according to this Word, it is becauſe there is no Light in them:</hi> Now let them ſhew, if they are able, that either the Law or Teſtimony of Chriſt ſpeaketh any thing to the Juſtification of their doings, their ſilent Meetings of Meditations or Mutterings, their ſlighting the Word of God, the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of Truth, &amp; ſetting up their own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions under the name of the Light with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in? for what ever they boaſt of <hi>Light, Light,</hi>
                  <pb n="167" facs="tcp:153030:97"/> here is an obſolute ſentence upon them, that there is <hi>no light</hi> in them. Oh that all that hear might fear, and not perſiſt with them to their own deſtruction! When men and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan enter into Covenant, when men hold Meetings to carry on his deſign, to publiſh his Doctrine, to communicate his Spirit; <hi>Oh my Soul, come not thou into their ſecrets, unto their Aſſembly mine Honour be not thou united,</hi> Gen. 49. 6. for they <hi>reject</hi> with the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Papiſts, the Counſel of God, and ſet up their own unwritten Traditions;</hi> they are gone a ſide after Satan, whoſe Doctrine they publiſh, and whoſe unclean ſpirit, they hold aſſemblies in ſilence to communicate.</p>
               <p>But Thirdly, It is further manifeſt, even by the confeſſion of ſome of your own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Proſelytes, who are and have been owned by you, as in your Miniſtry, and of your way, that an evil ſpirit is by you com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated; as for inſtance, There came a ſpirit into one of you, as he was going to reprove another, which did roar and make ſuch a terrible noiſe in his belly, that one might have heard it near a furlong from him, the which he himſelf did confeſſe to be the <hi>Devil;</hi> Another, (and one that is as a brand pluckt out of the fire,) did teſtifie
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:153030:98"/> before many witneſſes, that when he did joyn with thoſe that preach up the Light within, a ſpirit came into him, which did make him quake and tremble ſo exceeding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that he thought it would have tore him in pieces, which the Spectators were ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fraid to behold, that they called in ſeveral other perſons to help hold him in his Bed, which they had much ado to perform, the Bed on which he lay, did ſhake ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; which violence, was the motion of the evil ſpirit, with which his own Spirit did not conſent: Another, who is now bodily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, did confeſs a little before her death, that there did a ſpirit ſpeak in the bottom of her Belly, with a vocal voice, to the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the outward ear, and bad her <hi>go and leave her Kindred, and Houſe, and all therein, and Preach where it would have her, and it would reward her three-fold, &amp;c.</hi> The ſaid party within a very little time after, was found dead in a Furrow of Water: And thus a dear Friend of mine was deluded, and by your means deſtroyed, which I cannot forget, while I remember my ſelf.</p>

<pb n="169" facs="tcp:153030:98"/> been a great Preacher of &amp; to the ſo called Light within, &amp; ſuch a one that was conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded both by himſelf &amp; others, to have attair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>ſtate of Perfection,</hi> for ſeveral years paſt; the ſaid party being at a great Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, of thoſe that are called <hi>Preachers and followers of the Light within, &amp;c.</hi> When they, with ſuch others as came to hear, and himſelf alſo expected, that he ſhould have been the Teacher of the reſt, to have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the way to the ſtate of perfection; yet ſo it was, that a ſpirit entred into him, as he ſate behind the Table, which did cauſe his Feet to faſten to the frame of the Table, whereon he had ſet them, and did cauſe his knees to clap together, and there to ſtay, and his arms to lock together, and ſo to abide, it did cauſe his mouth to ſhut, his eyes to fix; and thus did he ſit bound hand and foot, and could not move any mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of his body, being in ſuch a maze in his own ſpirit, that he knew not what to do, the beholders alſo admired that it ſhould be thus with him; but his lord and maſter having taken poſſeſſion of him, will now do his work before he leave him; for firſt of all, he ſet all his ſins that ever he had done in all his life before him, at which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, having concluded before, that he

Yea ſuch was the operation of the wicked one upon others alſo, that ſeveral of them that heard, fell down in the houſe quaking and trembling exceedingly; and when this ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit had done ſpeaking in this party, it left him, and though he was before ſo exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>But Secondly, Neither are you in Unity among your ſelves, but one Preacheth one thing, and another Printeth the contrary; and this is done by ſuch as are eminent amongſt you; as for inſtance, One abſolutely affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that the <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> ſpoken of in the Scriptures, and appointed by the <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to be Eaten and Drunk in remembrance of him, is</hi> not <hi>Temporal, Viſible,</hi> or <hi>External Bread and Wine,</hi> of the ſame ſubſtance with that which men feed upon, but that it is <hi>Spiritual, Inviſible</hi> and <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal;</hi> But is not this Popery? Another of great eſteem amongſt you, ſayeth in Print, That that <hi>Bread and Wine, is common Bread and Wine,</hi> yea ſuch as may be eaten, not only by <hi>Believers at the Lords Supper,</hi> but even at an unbelievers Feaſt, or by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:153030:105"/> and unbelievers together. Now it may be obſerved by the way, that this concluſion undenyably follows the latter Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion, That ſo often as an unbeliever eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and drinketh his temporal food, ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>he eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> if the latter Doctrine be true; and if the former be true, then ſome perſons may <hi>eat and drink damnation to themſelves,</hi> in eating and drinking <hi>Spiritual, Inviſible,</hi> and <hi>Eternal</hi> food, becauſe they may poſſibly eat it, and drink unworthily, as ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>He that eateth and drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himſelf, not diſcerning the Lords Body,</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 27, 29.

But as this Doctrine is contrary to his, that ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Bread and Wine, to be ſpiritual onely and inviſible (and if it be onely ſpiritual and eternal, why ſhould the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual preſence of Chriſt put an end to it) as

Neither had <hi>Paul</hi> given that direction about it, which he did, as it is written, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 23, 24, 25, 26. Thus are the Preachers up of thee ſo called Light within, divided in their Doctrine; for ſet any two of theſe opinions together, and behold what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion there is?

                     <hi>That the Preachers up of the ſo called</hi> Light within, <hi>do deny the Doctrine of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, to be the Word of God; that although Chriſt is truly called the Word of God, yet the Doctrine of the Scriptures, is truly ſo to be called and accounted; That it is very dangerous to add to, or take from the Scriptures; That thoſe that contemn the Doctrine of the Scriptures of Truth, do deſpiſe Jeſus Chriſt, and God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: The reaſon why ſuch as deſpiſe the Scriptures, find no more vertue in them; Eight Conſiderations to prove the Doctrin of the Scriptures to be the Word of God, and an infalliable Teacher; Two other grounds to prove the former concluſion; the firſt taken from the Light which is in the Scriptures, the latter from the power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation of the Doctrine thereof up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearts of Believers.</hi>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>1</label> BUt if the Preachers up of the ſo called <hi>Light within,</hi> were able to juſtifie their way and Practice by the Scriptures, it is likely they would endeavour ſo to do;
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:153030:116"/> but being unable thereby to carry on their deſign, they endeavour by ſuch like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as are uſed by the Popiſh Synagogue, to juſtifie themſelves as we have heard; and that they may proceed with the greater ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, they <hi>deny the Doctrine of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures of the Old and New Teſtament, commonly called the Bible, to be the Word of God:</hi> for the diſcovery therefore of their wickedneſſe herein, and for the vindicating the Bleſſed Doctrine of Salvation contained in the Scriptures, that which here followeth is intended to conclude this work.</p>
               <p>For firſt, That thou that preacheſt up the ſo called <hi>Light within, &amp;c.</hi> doſt deny the Doctrine which is contained in that Book, called the Bible, to be the Word of God, appears by thy reproachful language con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it; yea, in words at length, ye do familliarly deny it to be the Word of God, one of you laying that Bible upon the ground, and ſetting his feet upon it, ſaid, If this be the Word of God, why doth it not ſtir and ſpeak? Thus ye delight to abuſe the Scriptures, and becauſe ye can ſo do, therefore ye conclude, they are not the Word of God; and being lifted up with Pride, and filled with Rage againſt the Word of God, expreſſed in the Scriptures
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:153030:117"/> of Truth, ye call all ſuch <hi>Carnal</hi> as give them that Title, giving this reaſon for your ſo doing, <hi>viz. Becauſe the Scripture ſaith Chriſt is the Word of God;</hi> and therefore ye conclude the Scripture is not the Word of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to colour over your deceit, ye alledge a ſentence of Scripture, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently declare a falſehood, ſaying, <hi>The Word of God is quick and Powerful,</hi> which is true, <hi>but the Scripture is a dead Letter,</hi> which is falſe; thus ye fume out diſdain againſt the Scriptures, and againſt thoſe that acknowledge them to be <hi>the Word of God,</hi> and a <hi>word of Power</hi> to them which do believe. But,</p>
               <p>Secondly, That I may make thy igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, with thy enmity unto the Scriptures manifeſt, I ſhall undertake, by Divine aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, to prove them <hi>to be the Word of God, and an infallible Teacher to them which do believe:</hi> for although the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture doth ſay; that Chriſt is the Word of God; yet it doth alſo affirm that his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment, contained in the Scriptures, is the Word of God; and as I did never deny the former, ſince I was inſtructed in the Doctrine of the Scriptures; ſo I do affirm that whoſoever doth own the Scriptures to be the Word of God; doth not deny that
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:153030:117"/> Chriſt is the Word of God, neither can ſuch a thing be layed to their charge, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing great injury to them; but I ſay, as it is true, that <hi>Chriſt is the Word of God,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, Revel. 19. 13. So it is as true, that <hi>the Scripture is the Word of God,</hi> as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 13.</p>
               <p>
                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> It might therefore well be concluded, that they which are ſo curious, as to make a diſtinction betwixt the words <hi>you</hi> and <hi>thou,</hi> may as well be able (if they be not wilfully or maliciouſly blind) to make an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement of the <hi>Word of God, as it is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven forth in the Scriptures,</hi> and <hi>the Word of God as it is Eſſentially in Chriſt.</hi> Are the Precepts, Promiſes and Threatnings, which are a main part of the Scriptures, and were the Word of God before they were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures, I ſay, are they the leſs the Word of God, becauſe they are writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures? Is not the <hi>Truth</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures, <hi>eternal</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible,</hi> becauſe the Ink, and Paper, is ſubject to alteration? <hi>Shall we think ſo of the Truth therein expreſſed? God forbid,</hi> And what leſs then an Almighty hand, hath preſerved that Book, <hi>viz.</hi> the Bible, unto this preſent hour, notwithſtanding all the rage and fury of the Devll, and his inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="208" facs="tcp:153030:118"/> againſt it? who now being unable to ſuppreſſe it by force, have deviſed this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> To teach all men to hearken to the <hi>Light within them,</hi> thereby to turn away their minds from the Doctrine of the Scriptures.</p>
               <p>Concerning therefore the Purity and Eternity of the Doctrine of Salvation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the Scriptures, the Scripture doth give ample Teſtimony in many places. The <hi>Words of the Lord, ſaith David, are pure words, as ſilver tryed in a Furnace of earth, purified ſeven times,</hi> Pſal. 12. 6. <hi>Every Word of God,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>is Pure, he is a ſhield to them that put their truſt in him,</hi> Prov. 3. 5. <hi>The entrance of thy words</hi> ſaith David, <hi>giveth Light, it giveth under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding to the ſimple,</hi> Pſal. 119. 130. <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and Earth,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ſhall paſſe away, but my Words ſhall not paſſe away,</hi> Mat. 24. 35. <hi>Whoſoever therefore,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>ſhall be aſhamed of me, and of my words, of him ſhall the Son of man be aſhamed, when he cometh in the Glory of his Father with the holy Angels,</hi> Mark 8. 38. Therefore ſaid <hi>Peter</hi> unto the Lord, when Jeſus ſaid unto the Twelve, <hi>Will ye alſo go away? Lord,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to whom ſhall we go? Thou haſt the Words of Eternall Life, and we believe, and</hi>
                  <pb n="209" facs="tcp:153030:118"/> 
                  <hi>are ſure, that thou art that Chriſt the Son of the living God,</hi> John 6. 67, 68, 69.</p>
               <p>Thus is the <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Eternity</hi> of the Truth expreſſed in the Scriptures, vindicated; yea, it will be found to be ſo unchangeable, that thoſe that now deſpiſe it, ſhall lie un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the puniſhment therein threatned to the contemners thereof for ever, and ever; as thoſe that <hi>imbrace the precious promiſes,</hi> obey the <hi>holy Commandments,</hi> and fear <hi>the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Threatnings declared in the Scriptures,</hi> ſhall enjoy in <hi>ſpirit, ſoul and body, the bleſſednes of Life Eternal;</hi> and although now the <hi>proud contemners of God, and of his Word,</hi> that dare tread the Bible under their feet, in ſcorn of the Doctrine expreſſed therein, <hi>are called Happy, and thoſe workers of wickedneſs, are ſet up</hi> in the minds of many; yet the time will come; <hi>when God will make up his Jewels, and ſpare them, as a man ſpareth his own ſon that ſerveth him; and then will there be a diſcerning between the Righteous and the Wicked; between him that ſerveth God, and him that ſerveth him not.</hi> See Mal. 3. 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18.</p>

                  <hi>Divine Nature,</hi> and alſo in the fulneſs of time, <hi>according to his Humane Nature;</hi> So no other Doctrine whatſoever, is the Word of God, ſo as the Doctrine of the Scriptures of the Old and New Teſtament is the Word of God; <hi>for God wrote the words of the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and gave the Record of his Son,</hi> whoſe Doctrine and Miracles are written, <hi>that ye might believe that Jeſus is Chriſt the Son of God; and that believing ye might have Life through his Name,</hi> John 20. 30. Which <hi>Doctrine of the Scriptures,</hi> our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt (who as God and man in one Perſon, is called the Word of God) <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be the Word of God,</hi> when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Scribes and Phariſees, for their <hi>making void the Commandment of God, that they might keep their own Traditions; making,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Word of God of no effect,</hi> &amp;c. In which ſentence it is very evident, that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt <hi>cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Commandment of God, expreſſed in the Scriptures, The Word of God.</hi> See Mark 7. And to this agrees the words of the Apoſtle, 2 Cor. 2. 17. <hi>For we are not as many, which corrupt or deal deceitfully with the Word of God, but as of ſincerity, but as of God, in the ſight of God, ſpeak we in Chriſt.</hi> That <hi>Word of God,</hi> which they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:153030:119"/> did not corrupt, was the Doctrine which they delivered from God to the People concerning Jeſus Chriſt, and Salvation by him, which they delivered both by word of mouth, and by writing.</p>
               <p>And as it is obſerved, that the Hebrew word which is tranſlated <hi>Commandments,</hi> doth ſignifie <hi>Words,</hi> as <hi>Exod.</hi> 34. 28. <hi>He wrote upon the Tables, the Words of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the ten Words or Commandments;</hi> which, withall other Commandments of the <hi>old Covenant,</hi> is called the <hi>Word</hi> or <hi>Doctrine of God;</hi> So alſo the <hi>Words of Chriſt</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the Scriptures of the new Covenant, is truely called the <hi>Word or Doctrine of God;</hi> though <hi>Moſes</hi> and other <hi>Prophets ſpake</hi> and <hi>wrote</hi> it, yet the <hi>Word or Doctrine, is the Word or Doctrine of God;</hi> for theſe <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly men of God, ſpake as they were moved by the holy Spirit,</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 21. So although <hi>Peter, Paul,</hi> and the reſt of thoſe <hi>holy Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men</hi> of the Scriptures of the new Covenant, did ſpeak &amp; write the Doctrine therein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; yet the Doctrine, is the <hi>Word or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle teacheth, 2 Cor. 3. 5. <hi>Not that we are ſufficient to think any thing of our ſelves, as of our ſelves, but our ſufficiency is of God, who alſo hath made us able Miniſters of the New Teſtament,</hi>

For whoſoever doth ſpeak a word againſt the Scriptures, ſpeaketh againſt him, whoſe Will is therein expreſſed; yea, whoſoever ſpeaketh diſdainfully and reproachfully of the Seriptures, ſpeaketh ſo againſt God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; for was it ever known, that the <hi>Word, Law,</hi> or <hi>Commandment</hi> of a King, was contemned, and evil ſpoken of, but the KIng who gave that <hi>Law, Word</hi> or <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment,</hi> was alſo thereby diſhonoured, and his <hi>Name or Power diſpiſed?</hi> Is a Kings Honour bound up in his Laws? and is not the Honour of the great God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Laws? will earthly Kings puniſh the contemners of their Commands, as far as their Power dorh extend? and will not <hi>the King Eternal, whoſe Power is univerſal?</hi>

So he now ſuffers his Word to be deſpiſed; which notwithſtanding, he will one day <hi>Vindicate,</hi> to the utter <hi>Confuſion</hi> of the <hi>Enemies thereof; he gave his Back to the ſmiters, and his Cheekes to them that plucked off the hair, and hid not his Face from ſhame and ſpitting;</hi> he was <hi>mocked, crowned with Thorns, Scourged, nailed to the Croſſe, Crucified and ſlain;</hi> and what <hi>Power</hi> or <hi>vertue</hi> did his Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuters

If thou be the Chriſt, come down from the Croſſe,</hi> ſaid <hi>they, and we will believe thee.</hi> To like pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe theſe blaſphemers of God, and of his Truth, when they have caſt the Scriptures on the ground, have ſaid, <hi>Riſe up, if thou be the Word of God.</hi> Oh the wonderful patience and forbearance of God! Oh the wretchedneſſe and perverſneſſe of man! <hi>God ſent his Son to ſave men, men Crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; he ſent his Word to instruct men, men deſpiſe it, and tread it under their feet;</hi> they can now call the Scriptures, lifeleſs, and ſay, they have no vertue in them; what might not they have ſaid, that nailed Chriſt to the Croſs? It is recorded, that <hi>a woman did but touch the hem of his Garments, and virtue came out of him;</hi> but they that Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified him, might have ſaid, that they had both <hi>touched and felt him,</hi> and yet found <hi>no vertue come out of him.</hi>
               </p>

               <p>The Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo teacheth the ſame Doctrine; for after he had declared, what they which were with Chriſt in the Mount had ſeen, and heard, he tells us, that <hi>we have a more ſure word of propheſie, or of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, whereunto ye do well,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that ye take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place, until the day dawn, and the day ſtar ariſe in our hearts;</hi> that is, as hath been already ſhewed, until the Reſurrection of the dead, <hi>and coming of Chriſt from heaven, with his mighty Angels,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Now we know, that a ſhining <hi>Light</hi> in a dark place, is of great uſe; of ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment is the Doctrine of the Scriptures, as the Prophet Teacheth, <hi>The Commandment of the Lord is pure, ſaith the Prophet, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightening the eyes,</hi> Pſal. 19. 8, 9. <hi>Thy word is a Lamp unto my feet,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and a light unto my paths;</hi> Oh! of what bleſſed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:153030:124"/> are the Scriptures of Truth, to direct in the way of the Lord, unto which <hi>ſure word of Prophecie, or of the Prophets and Apostles of Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall do well, if we take heed, as unto a Light that ſhineth in a dark place;</hi> remembring this firſt, <hi>that no Propheſie of the Scripture, is of any private interpretation; for the Propheſie came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God ſpake as they were moved by the holy Spirit;</hi> They are not therefore of private or particular interpretation, as though they did concern one time, or the men on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly which ſpake them; But they are of a general interpretation, and do concern, as <hi>they are Propheſies, and declare the Doctrine of Salvation, all times, and People,</hi> as ſaith the Prophet; <hi>This ſhall be written for the generation to come, and the People which ſhall be created, ſhall praiſe the Lord,</hi> Pſ. 102. 18. <hi>Bow down thine ear,</hi> ſaith <hi>Solomon, and hear the words of the Wiſe, they ſhall be fitted in thy lips, that thy truſt may be in the Lord; have not I written to thee excellent things, that I might make thee to know the certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the words of Truth, that thou mighteſt anſwer the words of Truth, to them that ſend unto thee:</hi> See Pro. 22. 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22.</p>

Yea, it is an evident Argument, that they which are ſtrangers to what I here ſay, let their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion be what it will, Truth was never yet eſpouſed to their Souls, never did any <hi>man of God</hi> ſay that the <hi>Scripture is a dead Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> a <hi>Carnal thing,</hi> to <hi>feed the Carnal</hi> mind; Oh the Darkneſs that is in ſome that boaſt of <hi>Light!</hi> who can call the holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures a dead Letter, a Carnal thing to feed the Carnal mind, and yet themſelves do fill the Nation with Books and Writings; what may one think of this, but that they do ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

               <p>How much therefore is it to be lamented, that the Scriptures of Truth ſhould be ſo villified and reproached, and that any ſhould be ſo deluded as wholly to neglect the reading of them, and let them lie in the corners of their houſes, without all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of them? alas, it was not ſo with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in the Marian dayes, when one Book of it was at five pounds value, and for the leaſt <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> a man would give a load of hay, and carry it up to <hi>London</hi> into the Bargain; but now we having plenty, men dare abuſe it, and tread it under their feet, and becauſe it doth not cry out with a vocal voice, and reprove, in and by it ſelf alone; therefore they conclude it is worth nothing, and yet can highly eſteem of their own Books, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they can do as little.</p>
